# LaTeX resume template

## Installing pre-requisites (Windows)

1. Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex), a TeX distribution for Windows that includes a large number of major packages.

2. Install an editor to edit and compile LaTeX documents. I recommend [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) or [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).

**Important**: Make sure to compile with XeLaTeX, not PDFLaTeX.
